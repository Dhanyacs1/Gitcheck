	the story behind this Jewel on the East Coast. Once a small fishing
	village, Visakhapatnam had witnessed the reigns of Ashoka, the
	Pallavas, the Cholas and the Gangas. Today you can see the country's
	largest shipbuilding yard with natural harbor and beach, stretching
	endlessly against the backdrop of low hills and dotted with secluded
	caves and creeks. The picturesque beaches and the 30 km's long
	Bheemili-Visakhapatnam coastal road that runs along the sea offer
	scenes of breathtaking beauty. The blue waters caressing the golden
	sands at different points along the length of the coast thrill
	fun-loving holiday makers underlying the fun and relaxation wherever
	you go and whatever you do. In Visakhapatnam, there are two prestigious
	universities one is ANDHRA UNIVERSITY and the other one is the
	prestigious and oldest medical colleges, ANDHRA MEDICAL COLLEGE. Also,
	there are many reputed colleges, schools, and other educational
	institutions. Keeping in view the sustainable development, the Greater
	Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation brings a conscious change to
